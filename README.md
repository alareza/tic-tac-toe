# tic-tac-toe
 Tic-tac-toe game implemented in JavaScript. When I began this project, I first
 implemented the game using classes in script2.js because I was more comfortable
 with using classes. Afterwards, I converted the Gameboard & GameController
 classes into functions that follow the Module Pattern and I converted the
 Player class into a factory function.

 Completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
